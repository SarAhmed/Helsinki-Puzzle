Grid Puzzle
## Description
Given a square grid of size N, where the horizontal rows are numbered 1 to N from
top to bottom and the vertical columns are numbered 1 to N from left to right.
You must place a number in each cell of the N by N grid such that :-
* Each row is unique.<br/>
* Each row is exactly equal to one of the columns, however, it must not bethe column with the same index as the row.<br/>
* If X is the largest number you place in the grid, then you must also place1,2,...,X-1, where the condition X ≤ N is satisfied.<br/>
## Example

For a 4 × 4 grid, you may have the following matrix

|    | `c1` | `c2` | `c3` | `c3`|
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `r1`| 1    |2     |   3  | 1   |
|`r2`  |3     |4     |   4  |2    |
|`r3`  |2     |4     |4     |3    |
|`r4`  |1     | 3    | 2    | 1   |

defined by the following equalities:
* c1 = r4
* c2 = r3
* c3 = r2
* c4 = r1
